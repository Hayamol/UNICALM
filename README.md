### Project Description
The project UNICALM is a mental health assessment web application that guides users through a stress level test.
It includes interactive screens,animations and a multi-step form to assess stress,sleep,diet, and lifestyle habits.
The results provide tailored stress management tips and routines.

### The Problem statement
A ridiculous problem this code solves is helping people realize they are stressed-even when it's painfully obvious!
Instead of just noticing their messy sleep schedule,junk food diet,and constant headaches,users now have a whole interactive
test to confirm what they probably already know: they need to chill out!

### The Solution
I'm solving it by taking something everyone already knows(stress is a problem) and wrapping it in a glorified quiz that 
spits out the same answer every time: "Yep,you're stressed!" Basically,it's like a weather app telling you it's raining 
while you're standing in the rain.But hey,atleast now it's official!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: HTML,CSS,Javavscript
- Frameworks used: Frontend,Animations&Effects,Progress tracking and interactivity
- Libraries used: Bootstrap 5.3.0,Poppins,Font Awesome 5,Bootstrap JS,CSS keyframes & Transitions,Javascript Functions
- Tools used: Code editor,Frontend frameworks and Tools,Javascript and UI Tools,Design and Animation Tools
### Implementation
For Software:In this project, HTML is used to structure the web page, creating the layout for the stress assessment form, including the questions, options, and progress bar. CSS is applied to style the page, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design with attention to colors, fonts, and spacing for a better user experience. JavaScript is used to handle the interactivity of the application, such as tracking the user's answers, updating the progress bar, calculating the stress score, and providing feedback at the end of the assessment. Together, these technologies work seamlessly to create a functional and engaging web application.

### Project Documentation
For Software:The Stress Assessment Web Application is a simple tool designed to help users evaluate their stress levels by answering a series of questions. The app presents a questionnaire with multiple-choice options, tracks the userâ€™s progress through a dynamic progress bar, and calculates a stress score based on their responses. Once completed, the app provides feedback on whether the user has low, moderate, or high stress. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app offers a user-friendly interface and can be easily accessed through a web browser.
